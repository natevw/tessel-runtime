Approxidate

This library is from the original Linus Torvalds' original `/git/date.c`, but it also has the ability to return microseconds. The function exposed on the Tessel will return milliseconds since epoch. The github library that this code was taken from can be found [here](https://github.com/thatguystone/approxidate).
